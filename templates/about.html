    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>Hello! I'm Pranesh Karthick, an aspiring AI developer with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My journey in the field of computer science began with my Bachelor's degree, and I am currently expanding my knowledge and skills through a Master's program in Artificial Intelligence at Queen Mary University of London.</p>
        
        <p>I am proficient in Python programming and have experience in SQL database management, UI development, and AI model creation. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've worked on various projects using TensorFlow and other machine learning frameworks.</p>
        
        <p>As a Jr. Software Developer at IndiAps in Chennai, I gained valuable industry experience that helped me understand how theoretical concepts translate into practical applications. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest developments in the rapidly evolving field of AI.</p>
        
        <p>My goal is to become an AI specialist who can leverage data-driven approaches to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact. I am particularly interested in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision applications.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy [your hobbies or interests - e.g., exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, participating in hackathons, etc.].</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">My Approach</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>I believe in a systematic approach to problem-solving, which involves:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-left: 1.5rem; position: relative;">
                <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: var(--accent-primary);"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span>
                <strong>Understanding the problem domain</strong> - Before diving into coding, I thoroughly research and understand the problem I'm trying to solve.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-left: 1.5rem; position: relative;">
                <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: var(--accent-primary);"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span>
                <strong>Data-driven decisions</strong> - I believe that good AI solutions start with good data analysis and preparation.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem; padding-left: 1.5rem; position: relative;">
                <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: var(--accent-primary);"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span>
                <strong>Iterative development</strong> - I follow an iterative approach to model building, continuously testing and refining my solutions.
            </li>
            <li style="padding-left: 1.5rem; position: relative;">
                <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; color: var(--accent-primary);"><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span>
                <strong>Ethical considerations</strong> - I am committed to developing AI solutions that are fair, transparent, and beneficial to society.
